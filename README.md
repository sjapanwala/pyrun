### Some FAQ ðŸ™‹
**if you have a question not listed here, please open an** ***Issue*** **, and we will resolve it ASAP**
-  **What if I have an alias, or another program running the 'py' prefix?**
    - If you would like to change the prefix, you would have to alter the `install.sh` file.
    1. Run the install command, but abort it with `ctrl + c`.
    2. Using a text editior of your choice, change the `$TARGET_PATH` change the `py` to the prefix of your choice.
    > Keep in mind: since the prefix is changes, every command you run, `py` will need to be substituted with the prefix of your choice
